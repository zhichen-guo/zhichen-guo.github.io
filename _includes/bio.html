        <p>Hi! My name is Zhichen (zee-chen) and I’m a Chilean software engineer based in the US.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a software engineer and tech educator at <a href="https://www.colab.duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke University’s Innovation Co-Lab</a>,
        where I maintain the website of our professional 3D printing service, mentor student developers, and teach software development workshops to the Duke community.</p>
        <p>In the last year, I've mentored a student team building an agentic AI voice assistant and lead multiple workshops to help people take their first steps in LLMs, RAG, and using LLMs as teaching tools.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy biking, music (piano & bass guitar), cooking, and languages (currently learning Gujarati).</p>
